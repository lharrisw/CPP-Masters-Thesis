## Abstract
This thesis explores rigidity theorems and their application to a specific case in differential geometry. Chapter 1 provides a foundational understanding of rigidity theorems by introducing four key examples: Mostow rigidity, the sphere theorem, Berger's hypersurface rigidity, and a rigidity theorem involving the Schwarzschild metric. Chapter 2 delves into the geometry of the n-sphere. We present stereographic and longitude-latitude coordinate systems for the unit circle and sphere. We also prove the compactness and connectedness of the n-sphere, explore visualization techniques for the 4-dimensional 3-sphere, and detail calculations for the Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci curvature, scalar curvature, and shape operator of the 2-sphere. Additionally, we provide examples of hypersurfaces in both Euclidean 3-space and the 3-sphere, alongside the metric tensors for the n-sphere in both stereographic and longitude-latitude coordinates (without proof). Chapter 3 focuses on Theorem 2 from the referenced paper, ``Geometric Inequalities and Rigidity Theorems on Equatorial Spheres."  We provide an in-depth explanation of the theorem's outline and its proof, focusing on the geometry. Finally, Chapter 4 outlines potential directions for future research related to the concepts explored in the thesis.
